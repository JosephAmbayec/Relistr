# Relistr Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** July 28, 2025  
**Last Updated:** July 28, 2025

## Overview

Relistr is a Chrome browser extension that removes sponsored listings and advertisements from websites. This privacy policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the Relistr extension.

## Information We Collect

### Local Storage Only
Relistr stores the following information **locally on your device** using Chrome's storage API:

- **Extension Settings:** Your preferences for enabling/disabling the extension and global selectors
- **Custom Rules:** Any custom ad-blocking rules you upload or create
- **Whitelist:** Domains where you've disabled ad blocking
- **Usage Statistics:** Count of sponsored listings removed (stored locally for your reference)
- **Theme Preference:** Your choice of light or dark theme

### Information We Do NOT Collect
- **Personal Information:** We do not collect names, email addresses, or contact information
- **Browsing History:** We do not track or store which websites you visit
- **Website Content:** We do not read, store, or transmit webpage content
- **Search Queries:** We do not collect your search terms or queries
- **Analytics Data:** We do not use tracking pixels, cookies, or analytics services

## How We Use Information

The information stored locally is used solely to:
- Remember your extension preferences across browser sessions
- Apply your custom ad-blocking rules to websites
- Respect your whitelist of domains where blocking is disabled
- Display usage statistics in the extension popup
- Maintain your theme preference

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage:** All data is stored locally in your Chrome browser using Chrome's secure storage API
- **No External Transmission:** Your data never leaves your device or browser
- **Chrome Sync:** If you enable Chrome sync, your extension settings may sync across your Chrome installations (handled entirely by Google Chrome)
- **No Cloud Storage:** We do not operate servers or cloud storage for user data

## Data Sharing

We do **not** share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your information to third parties because:
- We don't collect personal information
- All data remains on your local device
- We have no access to your stored preferences or usage data

## Permissions Explained

Relistr requests the following Chrome permissions for legitimate functionality:

- **Storage:** Store your preferences and custom rules locally
- **ActiveTab:** Check the current website domain to apply appropriate blocking rules
- **Host Permissions (`<all_urls>`):** Inject content scripts to detect and remove sponsored content on websites

These permissions are used exclusively for ad-blocking functionality and never for data collection.

## Data Retention

- Data persists until you uninstall the extension or manually clear it
- No automatic data expiration since all storage is local
- You can reset statistics and clear custom rules at any time through the extension interface

## Your Control Over Data

You have complete control over your data:
- **View Settings:** Access all stored preferences through the extension options page
- **Delete Custom Rules:** Remove uploaded custom rule files at any time
- **Clear Statistics:** Reset usage counters through the extension popup
- **Whitelist Management:** Add or remove domains from your whitelist
- **Complete Removal:** Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data


## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted with an updated "Last Updated" date. Since all data processing is local, changes typically relate to new features or clarifications rather than data handling practices.

**Note:** Since Relistr processes all data locally and does not transmit information externally, traditional privacy concerns about data breaches, third-party sharing, or unauthorized access are significantly minimized.
